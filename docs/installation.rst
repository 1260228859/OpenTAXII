Install Python
--------------

Get the latest version of Python at http://www.python.org/download/ or with your operating systemâ€™s package manager. OpenTAXII works with Python 2.7, this version of Python includes a lightweight database called SQLite so you don't have to setup a database.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell; you should see something like::

	$ python
	Python 2.7.6 (default, Sep  9 2014, 15:04:36) 
	[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Install OpenTAXII
-----------------
To sandbox the project and protect system-wide python it is recommended to install OpenTAXII into a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ (*virtualenv*)::

Create a virtual environment named OpenTAXII::

   $ virtualenv OpenTAXII

Where ``OpenTAXII`` is a directory to place the new environment

Activate this environment::

   $ source OpenTAXII/bin/activate
   (OpenTAXII) $
   
Now install the latest OpenTAXII release from the `Python
Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ (PyPI) using ``pip``::  
 
   (OpenTAXII) $ pip install opentaxii

Without the virtual environment it's just::

   $ pip install opentaxii

.. note::
    Since OpenTAXII has `libtaxii <https://github.com/TAXIIProject/libtaxii>`_ as a dependency, the system libraries
    `libtaxii` will be installed. Check
    `libtaxii documentation <http://libtaxii.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#dependencies>`_ for the details.

To install OpenTAXII from source files: download tarball, unpack it and install it manually with::

   $ python setup.py install


Versioning
----------

Releases of OpenTAXII are given major.minor.revision version numbers, where major and minor correspond to the roadmap Intelworks has. The revision number is used to indicate a bug fix only release.
