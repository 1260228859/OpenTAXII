OpenTAXII is a robust Python implementation of TAXII Services that
delivers rich feature set and friendly pythonic API built on top of well
designed application.

## Getting started Using Docker

OpenTAXII can also be run using docker. This guide assumes that you have
access to a local or remote docker server, and wonâ€™t go into the setup
of docker.

To get a default (development) instance using docker

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
$ docker run -d -p 9000:9000 intelworks/opentaxii
```

> **NOTE:**
> OpenTAXII is now accessible through port 9000, with data stored
> locally in a SQLite database, and no authentication, using services defined
> in [services.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Intelworks/OpenTAXII/master/examples/services.yml) 
> and collections from [collections.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Intelworks/OpenTAXII/master/examples/collections.yml)

More documentation on running OpenTAXII in a container is found in the [OpenTAXII Docker Documentation](http://opentaxii.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docker.html).
